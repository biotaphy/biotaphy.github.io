# Results Package

In that package, the index.html file provides a landing point where you can browse the available outputs.  The “MCPA with Modeled Data” link shows the MCPA results, “Modeled Map Statistics” shows the results of the multi-species computations for various diversity metrics, “Browse Model Maps” shows the SDM map images, and the “Species Distribution Models Directory Listing” and “CSV Output Files from Multi-species Analyses Directory Listing” options provide access to the raw output files in the package.

 

For the MCPA outputs, the left window showing the tree shows the correlation between the distributions of each sister clade with the selected predictor.  Usually, these are best observed with “Env – Adjusted R-squared” and “BG – Adjusted R-Squared” which show the correlation with the environmental variables and biogeographic hypotheses respectively.  This correlation is indicated in the color of the nodes in the tree, with more red indicating a stronger correlation.  Clicking on a node will show the distributions of each of the sister clades under it.  One will be shown in red, the other blue, and sites where both sides are present are shown in purple on the map.

 

You can also select sites on the map using the rectangle or polygon select tools.  After selection, species present at the selected sites will be highlighted in red in the tree.

 

Selection via the tree or the map also highlights dots in the scatterplot on the right.  Each dot represents a site and their distribution is determined by the statistics you select.  This can be used to show common patterns of biodiversity between the statistics and the highlighted sites can give you an idea of their relative biodiversity.  I can provide more literature on that topic if needed.

 

You can also brush the sites in the scatterplot to highlight the corresponding sites on the map as well as the species present at those sites in the tree.

 

 

Going back to the index page, selecting the “Modeled Map Statistics” shows a heat map style display of a single site-based statistic.  You can select which statistic you wish to display from the drop down at the top of the page.  The scales is displayed at the right of the map and a description of the selected statistic can be found under the map.
